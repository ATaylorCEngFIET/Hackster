WARNING: Ignoring invalid XILINX_PATH location C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2017.4\patches\AR70530\vivado.
Resolution: An invalid XILINX_PATH location has been detected. To resolve this issue:

1. Verify the value of XILINX_PATH is accurate by viewing the value the variable via 'set XILINX_PATH' for Windows or 'echo $XILINX_PATH' for Linux, and update it as needed.

2. To unset the variable using on Windows using 'set XILINX_PATH=' or remove it from Advanced System Settings\Environment Variables. On Linux 'unsetenv XILINX_PATH'
