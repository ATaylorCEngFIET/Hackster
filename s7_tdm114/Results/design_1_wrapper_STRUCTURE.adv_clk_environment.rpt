Advanced Clock Environment Report:
From clock: Unknown Clock To clock: design_1_i.mig_7series_0.u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig.u_ddr3_infrastructure.clk_pll_i
Synchronized: 0
Unsynchronized: 3
Issue: Unknown Clock interacts with clock design_1_i.mig_7series_0.u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig.u_ddr3_infrastructure.clk_pll_i in an unsynchronized manner across domains. Recommendation: Add synchronizers or merge the domains. Turning on the option to auto-detect clock domains may help merge domains.

Issue: design_1_i.clk_wiz_0.inst.clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 interacts with clock design_1_i.mig_7series_0.u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig.u_ddr3_infrastructure.clk_pll_i in a synchronized manner within a single domain. Recommendation: Remove the synchronizers, or separate the domains.
