1. How to run the script:-

From the shell prompt in the current directory, issue the following command:-

./design_1.sh

This command will launch the 'compile', 'elaborate' and 'simulate' functions
implemented in the script file for the 3-step flow. These functions are called
from the main 'run' function in the script file. For IES this command will
launch the 'execute' function for the single-step flow.

The 'run' function first executes 'setup' function the purpose of which is to
create simulator specific setup files, create design library mappings and library
directories and copy 'glbl.v' from the Vivado software install location into the
current directory.

The 'setup' function is also used for removing the simulator generated data in
order to reset the current directory to the original state when export_simulation
was launched. This generated data can be removed by specifying the '-reset_run'
switch to the './design_1.sh' script.

./design_1.sh -reset_run

To keep the generated data from the previous run but regenerate the setup files
and library directories, use the -noclean_files switch.

./design_1.sh -noclean_files

For more information on the script, please type './design_1.sh -help'.

2. Additional design information files:-

export_simulation generates following additional files that can be used for
fetching the design files information or for integrating with external custom
scripts.

Name   : file_info.txt
Purpose: This file contains detail design file information based on the compile
         order when export_simulation was executed. The file contains information
         about the file type, name, whether belongs to IP, associated library and
         the file path.
